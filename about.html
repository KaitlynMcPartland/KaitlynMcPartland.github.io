		<p>I never considered myself an artistic person. I appreciated art but didn't think I could create anything myself. My senior year I took a black and white film photography course and a digital photography course. I loved it, my problem with my own art had always been that I couldn't convey what I imagined in my head. Photography let me show people the way I saw things.</p>
		<p>A few years after college I start experimenting with melting crayons onto canvas. I'd use a blowdryer for some of it but I also used other techniques including melting crayons slowly with a lighter for a drip effect, feeding them into a hot glue gun and squirting them out as well as ironing crayon shaving under a piece of wax paper</p>
		<p>About 2 years ago my parents encouraged me to take a painting workshop with a local artist, Chappy Valente. I was nervous, I'd never been able to draw or paint anything before. However, the style and way Chappy taught clicked with me. It was impressionistic painting so I didn't feel the pressure to paint something perfectly. It really worked for me.</p>
