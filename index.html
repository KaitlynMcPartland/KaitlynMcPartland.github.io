		<p>This is a <a href="http://www.christopherlovell.com/">link</a> to the webpage of artist Christoper Lovell</p>
		<p>Below are a few of my thoughts about his webpage</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It is clear and easy to navigate</li>
			<li>I like how some of his navigation links have drop down menus</li>
			<li>It is a little plain for my taste but that could be so as not to detract from his artwork</li>
		</ul>
